# Dijkstra-and-A-Star
A C# Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*

This project may expand into other Algorithms. However, I wanted to show how Dijkstra may perform like A* without any heuristics.
To showcase this, I implemented Dijktra's Algorithm to take into account heuristics. By default, we set h(n) = 0.

- Unit tests have been provided to show that heuristic search does work, including a pre-made Console App program that the user can change.

- Another visual confirmation of the implementation's correctness can be referenced to the Search Applet in AISPACE. The user
can download this applet and create Graphs that correspond to the one being used in the C# program (or any graph that a user wants to create).
